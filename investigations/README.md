## Investigations  

During the bootcamp I decided to give an overview presentation on Amazon Web Services (AWS).  While we spent time installing and configuring an AWS Elastic Cloud Compute (EC2) node in class, I wanted to provide some more context on what AWS and all the different services provided.  When logging into the AWS Dashboard for the first time, it can be pretty intimidating and lead to the question "What is all this stuff?".  As the most popular cloud computing platform, and something we are likely to encounter in a production environment, I wanted to at least provide the class an overview and resources for further information.
