# Project Luther  
#### Linear Regression  
#####*Topic:  Sports Movies, Comeback Kid or Down for the Count?*  

**Files in this repo:**  
*luther_notebook.ipynb:*  IPython notebook with the data processing and analysis.

*luther_slides.key:*  slides developed for project presentation.  

**Project Description:**  
This was our second project, a two-week endeavor focused on an analysis of the movie industry. That's pretty much all the background we got, with the exception that the project needed to focus on a problem that can be solved (or approached is a better word) using linear regression.  After contemplating topics focused on the Oscars and Studio success or critical acclaim, I decided to focus on something different all together: sports movies. The premise was this, despite recent successes of movies like “Creed” and “Concussion”, the sports genre still remains an underdog in comparison with other more established genres.  

There is a more detailed write-up of this project (in the spirit of movie sequels, there's a Part I and Part II) on my [blog](https://jasonsyp.github.io/).

*Data Acquisition:*  Beautiful Soup, and pandas.read_html (aka a huge timesaver)
