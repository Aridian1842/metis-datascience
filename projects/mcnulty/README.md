**Project Description:**  
This project focused on applying supervised classification machine learning methods.  We were given several topics to choose from, or could pick our own data set to focus on.  While an individual project, we were allowed to collaborate in groups.  Using a data set from the ever popular [UCI Machine Learning repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/), myself and several classmates decided to focus on diagnosing heart disease.  We each picked different aspects of the problem and collaborated on the cleaning and pre-processing of the data set.  

The data set itself is one of the most widely cited in published works and is from a major study by the Cleveland Clinic, together with the Hungarian Institute of Cardiology, Swiss University Hospitals, and Long Beach V.A. Medical Center.
