# Metis Final Project  
#### Topic:  *Prescription Drug Abuse in America*  

For my final project I chose to examine prescription drug abuse.  This is a growing epidemic in the U.S. and I wanted to do some exploratory analysis and see what the profile of addiction looks like so we can target prevention and treatment services accordingly.  

I was able to gather data from several sources, with my primary data set consisting of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention National Vital Statistics System (NVSS), and survey data from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health, the largest annual national and state-wide survey on substance abuse and mental health.  

Here is a [link to the D3 visualization](http://rawgit.com/jasonsyp/metis-datascience/master/projects/final/index.html) I created for my final project showing the drug overdose deaths by county from 2002-2014.
